## Planning

I planned to make a simple to do list, which can be updated to become a project manager, sharable between users. First goal was to do simple crud action on single resource `tasks` with a `one to many` relationship with `user` (user has many tasks), and wanted to make another resource `project`, which `has many` `users`, and `has many` `tasks`, and make `project` sharable between users, enabling them to see progress of a `project` as a team. I did not get a chance to work on `project` resource yet, but will be working on it as a personal project. I will also be looking to integrate a useful 3rd party api.
